## Packages and settings

First we load the packages necessary to knit this document.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(ggridges)
library(patchwork)

library(p8105.datasets)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
    echo = TRUE,
    warning = FALSE,
    fig.width = 8, 
  fig.height = 6,
  out.width = "90%"
)

theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))

options(
  ggplot2.continuous.colour = "viridis",
  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)

scale_colour_discrete = scale_colour_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d
```

# Problem 1: Instacart data

## Import data

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

## Describe the dataset

-   This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns, with each row
    representing a single product from an instacart order.

-   Variables include identifiers for user, order, and product; the
    order in which each product was added to the cart. There are several
    order-level variables, describing the day and time of the order, and
    number of days since prior order. Then there are several
    item-specific variables, describing the product name (e.g. Yogurt,
    Avocado), department (e.g. dairy and eggs, produce), and aisle
    (e.g. yogurt, fresh fruits), and whether the item has been ordered
    by this user in the past.

-   In total, there are 39123 products found in 131209 orders from
    131209 distinct users.

## Answer questions

-   How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items
    ordered from?

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # … with 124 more rows

There are 134 aisles, and the most items are ordered from the fresh
vegetables and fresh fruits aisles.
